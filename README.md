1) I plan to add another hero class for a Druid
2) I will need to add a druid.hpp and a druid.cpp
3) I will need to create a new input_6.txt to utilize the druid
4) I will need to update main to include druid.hpp, and add a new case  in the 'type' switch to initialize the druid
5) I may need to update database.json to add a druid character?
6) I will need to update the makefile to include the new class
