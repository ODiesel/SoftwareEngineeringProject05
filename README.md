I plan to add another hero class for a Druid
1) I will need to add a druid.hpp and a druid.cpp 
^^^^^^^^^^ DONE ^^^^^^^^^^
2) I will need to create a new input_6.txt to utilize the druid
3) I will need to update main to include druid.hpp, and add a new case  in the 'type' switch to initialize the druid
^^^^^^^^^^ DONE ^^^^^^^^^^
4) I may need to update database.json to add a druid character?
5) I will need to update the makefile to include the new class
6) I will need to change checkall.bash to include the new input_6.txt file
