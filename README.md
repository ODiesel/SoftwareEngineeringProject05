I plan to add another hero class for a Druid
DONE 1) I will need to add a druid.hpp and a druid.cpp
DONE 2) I will need to create a new input_6.txt to utilize the druid
DONE 3) I will need to update main to include druid.hpp, and add a new case  in the 'type' switch to initialize the druid
DONE 4) I may need to update database.json to add a druid character?
DONE 5) I will need to update the makefile to include the new class
DONE 6) I will need to change checkall.bash to include the new input_6.txt file
DONE 7) I will need to create an output_6.txt for checkall.bash to compare against
